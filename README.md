# face-mask-detection
Detecting face masks with CNNs using Tensorflow's Keras API. <br>
Dataset from [Kaggle Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset).<br>

## Objective
The goal of this project is to detect the presence of face masks in images.
## How to run
Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset). Data processing, model training and inference are all done in the Jupyter notebook file.
